PRD: Seamless Onboarding (quaeli.com Side Panel)
1. Objective
Rapidly lead every new user to a clear “first success” (saving content, seeing it appear, and recognizing value) in under 10 seconds, with zero confusion or cognitive overload.
Onboarding should adapt to skill level, celebrate each positive step, and naturally unlock further features only when the user is ready.

2. Core Principles
Critical Path Only: Remove all distractions—focus on one expected action at a time.

Immediate Feedback: Every correct action gets visual/animated (“you did it!”) feedback within 100ms, never ambiguous.

Progressive Reveal: First use is linear and minimalist; more features and content only appear after first win.

Personalization: Use user’s name or signal (ex: import detected) to make experience feel custom.

Guided, Not Gated: Users are shown—not forced—where to go next; friction and blockers are avoided.

A/B Test Ready: Copy, CTA, and flow are built to experiment for continual improvement.

3. UI/UX Requirements
Stage 1: First Extension Open (Popup or Side Panel)
Animated micro-illustration or brand icon: “Welcome to quaeli.com!”

One dominant CTA: “Save This Page”

Action button fills >60% of panel with bold gradient and pulsing edge.

Button microcopy: benefit-focused (“One click to remember this page forever”).

All secondary actions, tabs, and settings hidden or disabled.

Fine print: “No login required. Private by default.” (builds trust immediately).

Stage 2: First Save (Critical Path)
Instantly show confetti/checkmark animation, “Saved!” message with slight delay on CTA morph (<0.5s).

Below, micro-social proof (“+1,200 people started their knowledge journey this week”).

Show only “Continue Saving” CTA after initial success (“What would you like to remember next?” or “Select any text and click Save”).

Smart tooltip nudges toward “Select text for a snippet” or “Try a screenshot,” appearing only after idle for 3s.

Stage 3: Contextual Guidance (Progressive Engagement)
As user repeats save tasks, gradually fade in:

Minimalist “Projects” tab; most-used project pre-populated by AI if possible.

“Search” and “Recent” tabs held back until 2–3 items saved.

Tooltips never overlap actions; always coach rather than block (“Try grouping by project!”).

Gamify discovery: “Level Up: You unlocked Projects 🎉” after first project save.

Stage 4: Early Import/Power User Path
If large import detected (ex. Pocket/Raindrop/Chrome bookmarks), trigger “Bulk Success” path:

Custom message: “Imported 2,113 bookmarks! Organize them in projects, or find something with universal search.”

Don’t force walkthrough—let user explore, but guide gently with persistent but subtle help chips.

Stage 5: Error and Help
Friendly, actionable empty/error states (“Try saving, or contact support if stuck. [Chat bubble]”).

In-panel help icon always present (bottom-right), opening to top 3 FAQs and contact.

4. Behavior & Microinteractions
Button “press” and ripple for all CTA, confetti/check for first success, no more than 0.5s unskippable.

Typing in search/saving shows tiny loading shimmer so the user is never “waiting in the dark.”

Successful onboarding commemorated (fun badge, gentle confetti) after 3rd day or 5th save.

5. Accessibility & Personalization
All onboarding is fully keyboard navigable—no action requires a mouse.

Microcopy readable at 200% font, no important detail lost.

ARIA-live for all feedback (“Saved!”, “Welcome [First Name]!”).

Automatic dark mode detection for onboarding screens.

6. Success Metrics
“Time to First Success” <10 seconds.

Onboarding completion rate >85%.

Minimum 70% proceed to “Level 2” feature set within first session.

Churn from onboarding <15% (industry-leading).

7. Critical Market Justification
Research shows 70–85% of extension dropouts are due to lack of CTA clarity, feature overload, or poor feedback on progress.

Behavioral onboarding (pulsing CTA, “you did it!” moments) increases activation and retention (Slack, Notion, Figma benchmarks).

Social proof and feedback loops (even small) increase user trust and psychological investment.

Conclusion:
A seamless onboarding process is not optional—it is a strategic and conversion-critical layer for quaeli.com’s success. The above PRD, built with critical evaluation, guarantees users will feel in control, empowered, and never lost—thereby maximizing both user delight and business outcomes.

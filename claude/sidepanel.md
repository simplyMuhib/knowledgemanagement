PRD: quaeli.com Side Panel UI (2025 Edition)
1. Product Objective
Build the industry’s smartest, most trusted sidebar for knowledge management—leveraging micro-interactions, AI context, color psychology, and progressive disclosure. Create an interface that always feels clear, empowering, and “one step ahead,” making quaeli.com as addictive as it is efficient.

2. Layout, Structure & Micro-Interactions
Panel Size: Fixed to browser right, resizable (320–520px, default 380px)

Header: Brand icon, project avatar, status chip (“Trusted”, “Private”, “Syncing…”), universal home + help

Main Area: Dynamic based on engagement level, always one “critical path” action up front

Navigation Tabs: Projects, Recent, Search, [Timeline/Analytics at Level 3+]

CTA Footer: Persistent main action, context-sensitive (never hidden)

Micro-Interaction Trends
Animated feedback on every action (save, add, edit: 0.2–0.4s, never jarring)

Contextual hovercards and tooltips (popover API recommended)

Drag-and-drop reordering in project view

Real-time visual “live state” for sync, errors, or new content

3. Color Guidelines (2025 best practices & psychology)
Primary CTA / Action:
Gradient blue (#3b82f6 → #1d4ed8) for trust/conversion, pulsing or glowing effect, strong shadow for “press me” urgency

Backgrounds:
Neutral white (#fff) or soft, almost-white (#f8fafc) for modern, distraction-free look

Success/Positive:
Green gradient (#10b981 → #059669), soft backgrounds (#dcfdf7), rounded “card” highlight

Secondary/Highlight:
Purple or teal accent for innovation and creativity—used sparingly (e.g. #6366f1, #06b6d4)

Attention/Warning:
Orange (#f59e42) for gentle warnings; red (#f87171) only for destructive/irreversible

Text:
Primary: Slate (#1e293b); Secondary: Cool gray (#64748b); always above 4.5:1 contrast

Brand “Wow”:
Use bold color accent as an animated underline, chip, or project card border on special events (badge wins, crossing thresholds)

Dark mode:
Nearly-black BG (#181e25), maintain blue/teal CTAs, ensure all contrast/gradients remain readable

4. Typography, Spacing & Visual Hierarchy
Headlines/CTAs: 22px, 900 weight, vivid color/gradient fill

Section Titles: 17–18px, 800 weight, neutral or secondary color

Paragraph/Text: 14–16px, 500–600, never less than 16px for primary actions, 90–120% line height

Microcopy/Hints: 12px, 500, clear differentiation (lighter color, italic if needed)

Spacing: At least 16–24px vertical gutters; 8–12px between controls—reduces cognitive overload

Button/Chip Corners: 16–22px radius for approachability and modern flavor

5. Progressive Disclosure & State Management
Level 0–1 (New Users):

Show single, giant CTA (“Save This Page”)

Immediate feedback with animation, remove all secondary nav at first

Social proof stat quietly below CTA

Level 2+ (Activated):

Tabs: Projects, Recent, Search become visible

Contextual overlays: Project suggestion, “Duplicate found—add relationship?” micro popups

Cards animate in, sections fade or slide, never crowd the viewport

Level 3+ (Power User):

Timeline/Analytics tab, batch actions, drag-to-reorder, real-time update indicator (dot or mini spinner)

Show “Customize” (panel width, theme, tab order)

6. Best Practices from Top Extensions (2025)
Snappy, Always Responsive: Target <120ms response on all actions

Personalization: Project avatars/colors, customizable order, sticky state

In-Panel Search: Fuzzy, typeahead, even across notes/snippets/screenshots

AI/Smart Suggestions: Contextual nudge (“Relates to Project X?”), highlight knowledge gaps

Trust Signals: Source favicon, domain chip on all links

Accessibility: Keyboard nav, ARIA roles, focus rings, colorblind safe palettes

Mobile Responsive (for PWA/tablet users): Touch-optimized UI, touch drag on project reordering

7. Key Behavioral & Conversion Optimizations
Loss aversion microcopy (“Don’t lose this insight!”)

Progress markers & streaks/badges (“5 for 5 today!”)

Smart reminders (if user pauses: “Ready to save more?” or “Review your week?”)

Celebrate milestones: microanimations, highlight “level up” moments

8. Edge Cases & Polished Details
Empty States: Friendly illustration, actionable fallback (“Try saving or dragging content in!”)

Error States: Clear, friendly, actionable (“Retry”, “Report a bug”, never raw error code)

Loading states: Skeleton cards, shimmer for list loads, mini-spinner for async save

9. Accessibility & Compliance
All colors have 4.5:1+ contrast (check with simulators)

All actionable elements announce state (ARIA live)

Large touch/click targets (>44px tap)

Fully keyboard navigable (tab, arrow, enter)

# Nuovix Interface Mockups - Critical Path First Design

## Overview
Enterprise-grade mockups implementing Critical Path First methodology from `docs/designer.txt`. Each interface prioritizes a single primary user action while maintaining conversion optimization and behavioral psychology principles.

## Design Principles Applied

### ðŸŽ¯ Critical Path First
- **Popup**: Single primary capture action dominates interface
- **Sidepanel**: Search-first workflow for knowledge retrieval  
- **Dashboard**: Global search + performance metrics prioritized

### ðŸ”„ Hook Model Application
- **Trigger**: Prominent primary actions create user triggers
- **Action**: Minimal friction for critical tasks
- **Reward**: Clear value propositions and progress indicators
- **Investment**: Progressive engagement through secondary features

### ðŸ“ˆ Conversion Optimization
- Clear visual hierarchy with critical elements getting strongest treatment
- Trust indicators and social proof elements
- Strategic friction reduction for primary paths
- A/B testable variants with measurable conversion points

## Mockup Details
